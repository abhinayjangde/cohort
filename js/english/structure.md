1. Giving Instructions

"Let's start with..." → Let's start with variables in JavaScript.
"First, you need to..." → First, you need to declare a variable.
"Now, try to..." → Now, try to write a function that returns a value.
"Make sure to..." → Make sure to use const for constant values.
"Don't forget to..." → Don't forget to close the curly braces {}.
"You should always..." → You should always use meaningful variable names.
"Avoid using..." → Avoid using var, prefer let or const.
"Remember that..." → Remember that JavaScript is case-sensitive.

2. Explaining Concepts

"In JavaScript, we use..." → In JavaScript, we use let to declare variables.
"This means that..." → This means that const cannot be reassigned.
"For example,..." → For example, let x = 10; creates a variable.
"Let me show you..." → Let me show you how to write an arrow function.
"We can also..." → We can also use map() to iterate over an array.
"The difference between X and Y is..." → The difference between == and === is type checking.


3. Asking Questions to Engage Students
"Can you guess what this code does?"
"What will be the output of this function?"
"Why do you think this error is happening?"
"How can we improve this code?"
"Can you write a function that adds two numbers?"

4. Correcting Mistakes and Giving Feedback

"That's close, but you need to..." → That's close, but you need to use return inside the function.
"Good try! But there's a small mistake in..." → Good try! But there's a small mistake in the syntax.
"Check the console for errors."
"You forgot to add a semicolon."
"Try using a loop instead of repeating the code."

5. Encouraging Students
"Great job!"
"That's correct!"
"You're getting better at this!"
"Keep practicing, and it will become easy!"
"That's an interesting way to solve this problem!"
